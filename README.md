# Widget
JavaFx application that contains system details, weather, rss reader, cpu and memory monitor, network signal and speed monitor and battery status indicator.
Made into a widget like desktop application that currently supports linux and soon windows too.

Any feedback, suggestion or contribution is highly appreciated.
